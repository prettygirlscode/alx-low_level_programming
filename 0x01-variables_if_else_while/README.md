<h1>C - variables, if, else and while</h1>

Working on this project helped me understand the application and usage of arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators and variable declarations.
I learned how to use the if and if...else statements, i also learned how to declare and print values of variable type char, int and unsigned int. 
Learining how to use the while and for loop was quite an interesting experience.

<h3>Arithmetic operators and their usage</h3>

In C, arithmetic operations are carried using arithmetic operators such as <strong>addition</strong>, <strong>subtration</strong>, <strong>multiplication</strong>, <strong>division</strong> and <strong>modulus</strong>, are performed using arithmetic operators.  
Arithmetic operators need two operands between one operator to perform all operations successfully. 

<h3>Logical operators and their usage</h3>

There are three logical operators in the C language:
<ol>
  <li>&& The logical AND operator</li>
  <li>|| The logical OR operator</li>
  <li>! The logical NEGATION operator</li>
</ol>
The AND and OR operators, are binary operators; that is, they both take two operands (one to the left and one to the right of the operator).  
The logical AND operator (&&) is used to evaluate the truth or falsity of a pair of expressions. If either expression evaluates to 0 (that is, false) the
operator yields a value of 0. Otherwise, if — and only if — both operand expressions evaluate to nonzero values, the logical AND operator yields a value of 1 (that is, true).
